# DashboardScraper

This script scrapes real-time data every minute from a Google Analytics dashboard and a Queue-It dashboard. It then combines and exports the data into a CSV which can be fed in to a BI platform. This particular use case was to facilitate the monitoring and analysis historical real-time users on site and in queue.
